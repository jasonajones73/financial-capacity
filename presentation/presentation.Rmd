Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. The aggregate used to calculate per capita income is rounded. Per capita income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
